              <div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed "></i><i class="acc-open "></i>Use of Cookies</div>
              <div class="acc_content clearfix">
                <p>"Cookies" are small files that enable us to store information
                						related to your PC and you, the user, specifically, while you
                						visit one of our websites. Cookies help us to determine how
                						frequently our internet pages are accessed as well as the number
                						of users. And they help us configure our offers so that they are
                						as convenient and efficient as possible for you.</p>
                					<p>On the one hand, we use what are called "session cookies", those
                						that are stored exclusively for the duration of your visit to one
                						of our internet pages. On the other, we use "persistent cookies"
                						for retaining information about visitors who repeatedly access one
                						of our internet pages. The purpose of using cookies is to be able
                						to offer you optimal user guidance as well as to "recognize" you
                						and thus be able to present (as much as possible) diversified
                						internet pages and new contents during repeated use.</p>
                					<p>Generally, we do not create an individual profile of your online
                						activities. The content of a persistent cookie is limited to an
                						identification number. Name, email address, IP address, etc., are
                						not saved on the majority of our sites. There are four exceptions:</p>
                					<p>1) Eloqua Tracking Cookie. The content of this persistent
                						tracking cookie is limited to an identification number and is
                						generally used in exactly the same way as all of our other
                						persistent cookies. However, if you contact DHL using certain
                						online contact forms in the Logistics content area, your email
                						address is added to the cookie to create an individual profile of
                						your online activities. These same contact forms also provide you
                						with an option to sign up for email marketing updates. By giving
                						your permission, this also allows us to provide you with
                						personalized content, offers or promotions that may interest you.</p>
                					<p>Should you choose not to sign up for email marketing updates,
                						you will not be contacted in the future and your email address
                						will only be used confidentially by DHL internally to understand
                						your individual online activities. This means that we can still
                						continue to deliver new and improved website content to suit your
                						specific needs.</p>
                					<p>You can learn more about the Eloqua Tracking cookie in the DHL
                						Table of Cookies below.</p>
                					<p>Alternatively, to opt out of being tracked by Eloqua across all
                						websites (or to reverse your setting if you have previously opted
                						out), you can do so under 'How to Manage Cookies' below.</p>
                					<p>2) MediaMind Tracking Cookies. These persistent tracking cookies
                						collect your IP address and uses it to provide geographical
                						location data to help DHL monitor and manage advertising
                						campaigns. The cookies are completely encrypted and do not collect
                						any other personally-identifiable data, so the IP address cannot
                						be linked to personal data and is not shared with third parties.
                						The IP address is stored securely and only used confidentially by
                						DHL internally to provide aggregated reports. The cookies expire
                						after 30 days.</p>
                					<p>You can learn more about MediaMind Tracking cookies in the DHL
                						Table of Cookies below. Alternatively, to opt out of being tracked
                						by MediaMind across all websites, you can do so by clicking on the
                						MediaMind Opt-Out link below: MediaMind Opt-OutExternal Link / New

                						setting, click the MediaMind Opt-In link below: MediaMind
                						Opt-InExternal Link / New Window</p>
                					<p>3) Google Analytics Cookies. A small number of countries may use
                						Google Analytics cookies on a small scale for specific local
                						purposes. These cookies use your IP address as recognition,
                						however do not identify you as an individual. In other words,
                						information is collected in an anonymous form. The cookies collect
                						information about how visitors use our local sites and use the
                						information to compile reports and to help us improve local sites.</p>
                					<p>You can learn more about Google Analytics in the DHL Table of
                						Cookies below.</p>
                					<p>Alternatively, to opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics
                						across all websites, visit: Google Analytics Opt-out Browser
                						Add-onExternal Link</p>
                					<p>4) dotMailer Tracking Cookie. The content of this persistent
                						tracking cookie is limited to an identification number and is
                						generally used in exactly the same way as all of our other
                						persistent cookies. However, if you are already a DHL customer
                						contact or you contact DHL using certain online contact forms in
                						the Logistics content area, your email address is added to the
                						cookie to create an individual profile of your online activities.
                						These same contact forms also provide you with an option to sign
                						up for email marketing updates. By giving your permission, this
                						also allows us to provide you with personalized content, offers or
                						promotions that may interest you.</p>
                					<p>Should you choose not to sign up for email marketing updates,
                						you will not be contacted in the future and your email address
                						will only be used confidentially by DHL internally to understand

                					<h3>Use of nugg.ad Cookies</h3>
                					<p>
                						This website uses <a href="https://www.nugg.ad/en/">nugg.ad AG</a>
                						technology to monitor data on controlling advertising. In order to
                						do this, nugg.ad saves the frequency of use of various website
                						topics in the form of cookies. These cookies are stored in the
                						browser of your device (e.g. PC, laptop, smart phone etc.) for a
                						maximum period of 26 weeks. nugg.ad's technology may also save
                						basic information on your use of other websites in order to
                						estimate what advertising might interest you the most. It is not
                						possible for us to trace any information in the cookies back to
                						individual users. In particular we cannot identify a person by
                						name, address or any other data that is directly identifying.
                					</p>
                					<p>If you would like to see advertising on websites that are of
                						interest to you, then you can opt in to receive a further
                						theme-based analysis of your usage behavior. If you give your
                						agreement, then this opt-in cookie will also be stored in the
                						browser of your device. It will be stored for 1 year. If
                						previously collected nugg.ad cookies are present in the browser of
                						your device, by setting the opt-in cookie the following will
                						happen: with your permission the nugg.ad cookie lifespan is
                						lengthened to 1 year (calculated from the moment the cookie is
                						set). Information stored in nugg.ad cookies prior to opt-in is
                						retained and will be deleted upon expiration of the cookie
                						(maximum 1 year). You have the right to prevent the recording of
                						information by the nugg.ad system at any time by exercising your
                						right to opt out. If you have already given your consent, you can
                						also cancel it at any time, effective thereafter. An opt-out will
                						also be stored in a cookie in your browser's device with a
                						lifespan of 10 years, it will be named "nuggstopp", and will be
                						set by "nuggad.net".</p>
                					<p>If you are interested in opting in or opting out, you can do so

                					<h3>Use of Adcloud Cookie</h3>
                					<p>As you browse DHL websites, we use Adcloud technology to place
                						an advertising cookie in the browser of your device (e.g. PC,
                						laptop, smart phone etc.) so that we can understand what you are
                						interested in. The cookie lasts for a maximum period of 365 days
                						and enables us to present you with advertising on other sites
                						based on your previous interaction with DHL websites. Although we
                						collect data based on keywords to display the right ads to you on
                						other websites, it is not possible for us to trace any information
                						in the cookie back to you as an individual. In particular we
                						cannot identify a person by name, address or any other data that
                						is directly identifying. This website also uses Adcloud technology
                						to monitor advertising campaigns.</p>
                					<p>If you want Adcloud to stop tracking you, you can learn how to
                						do this under 'How to Manage Cookies' below.</p>
                					<h3>Sharing Tools: Third Party Cookies</h3>
                					<p>
                						DHL now uses embedded 'share' buttons on its websites. These make
                						it easy for visitors to bookmark and share content through their
                						favourite social networks. When you click on one of these buttons,
                						a cookie may be set by the service you have chosen to share
                						content through. DHL does not control the use of these cookies and
                						you should therefore check the relevant third party's website for
                						more information. The 'share buttons' are provided by AddThis. For
                						more information about their data collection practices, please
                						take a look at the <a
                							href="http://www.addthis.com/privacy/terms-of-service">AddThis
                							Privacy Policy</a>
                					</p>
                					<h3>Third Party Cookies in embedded content</h3>
                					<p>Please note that on some pages of our websites you may notice
                						that cookies have been set that are not related to DHL. When you
                						visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or
                						Vimeo, these service providers may set their own cookies on your
                						web browser. DHL does not control the use of these cookies and
                						cannot access them due to the way that cookies work, as cookies
                						can only be accessed by the party who originally set them. You
                						should check the third party websites for more information about
                						these cookies.</p>
                					<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
                					<p>In order to keep DHL's online content relevant, easy to use and
                						up-to-date, we use web analytics services such as Webtrends* to
                						help us understand how people use our websites. These services use
                						data collection technologies such as web beacons. Web beacons are
                						small electronic images that deliver cookies, count visits, and
                						understand usage and website effectiveness. In turn, this lets us
                						know what content is of interest to our visitors and helps us
                						provide tailored information on our websites. These web beacons
                						are anonymous and do not contain or collect any information that
                						identifies you. The information is anonymous and only used for
                						statistical purposes. Web analytics data and cookies cannot be
                						used to identify you as they never contain personal information
                						such as your name or email address.</p>

                						notify you when a cookie is sent. You can also delete cookies from
                						your PC hard drive at any time (file: "cookies"). Please note that
                						in this case you will have to expect a limited page presentation
